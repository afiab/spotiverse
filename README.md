## Accessibility
A screen reader should be able to read all the content on the website. The site is mobile friendly unless the mobile screen is less than 500 pixels wide, in that case the only thing that isn't mobile friendly is the game because it's sized by pixels.

The game has a text input field underneath it where players can
input commands to customize the colors of the shapes, background, 
and text in the game. The syntax is the keyword followed by the 
hex code. The input field is also labeled with the syntax
beforehand.

## Notes
I intended to use SpotifyAPI but couldn't understand the logistics of authentication, which is why I used a Kaggle Data Set instead. 

The Languages distribution for this project might show a large proportion of JavaScript; however, that is because I pasted an entire JSON file into a JavaScript file twice because it was taking too long to understand how to read a JSON file that is stored locally. This was also my first time working with JSON files and the p5.play language.
