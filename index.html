    <h2>Welcome to SpotiVerse!</h2>
    <h3>About the Site</h3>
    <p>I found a data set on Kaggle with the top 50 Spotify
        tracks for 73 countries (linked on GitHub if interested).
        A lot of people stick to the same categories of music 
        for pretty much their whole lives, especially in terms 
        of genre and country of origin. Using this data set, I 
        wanted to encourage people to explore trending songs in
        other countries as well.
    </p>
    <h3>Reference</h3>
    <p>The reference tab lets a user search for different
        statistics about a song. If the song they search is
        not trending, then no search results will appear. A 
        user can see the popularity score of a song (a number
        out of 100), a country it's currently trending in, and
        the artist for the song.
    </p>

    <h3> Play</h3>
    <p>This is where the real challenge lies. Users are 
        presented with a block stacking game, where the goal
        is to stack the most consecutive blocks on top of 
        one another. The less popular a song is according to its
        popularity index, the wider the block will be. To play,
        type the name of a song trending in the country presented,
        and press the Enter key to generate a block. The goal of 
        this game is to encourage users to explore songs from 
        origins they wouldn't consider, while also focusing more on
        less popular songs to help them play the game.
    </p>
    <p>Here are the commands to customize the game interface
        using the text box at the bottom of that page:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>background #hex000</li>
        <li>block #hex000</li>
        <li>platform #hex000</li>
        <li>text #hex000</li>
    </ul>
