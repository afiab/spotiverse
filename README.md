## Notes
I intended to use SpotifyAPI but couldn't understand the logistics of authentication, which is why I used a Kaggle Data Set instead. 

The Languages distribution for this project might show a large proportion of JavaScript; however, that is because I pasted an entire JSON file into a JavaScript file twice because it was taking too long to understand how to read a JSON file that is stored locally. This was also my first time working with JSON files and the p5.play language.
